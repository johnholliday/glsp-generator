# GLSP Generator Test Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the test failures identified and the fixes applied.

## Test Status
- **Total test suites**: 94
- **Passed suites**: 70 
- **Failed suites**: 24
- **Total tests**: 229
- **Passed tests**: 168
- **Failed tests**: 44

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **fs-extra Mock Issues**
**Problem**: Tests were failing with "default.existsSync is not a function"
**Root Cause**: The fs-extra mock wasn't providing both default and named exports correctly
**Fix Applied**:
- Created comprehensive fs-extra mock in `test/mocks/fs-extra.ts`
- Updated global test setup in `test/utils/setup.ts` to use the mock
- Updated individual test mocks to include all necessary methods

### 2. **Dependency Injection Issues**
**Problem**: GLSPGenerator constructor failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'info')"
**Root Cause**: GLSPGenerator expects `ILoggerService` but containers were only binding `Logger`
**Fix Applied**:
- Added `ILoggerService` to TYPES symbols
- Updated minimal-container.ts to bind both `Logger` and `ILoggerService`
- Created test helper (`test/helpers/glsp-generator-helper.ts`) for consistent mocking

### 3. **Memory Manager Test Issues**
**Problem**: Mock expectations not matching actual implementation
**Root Cause**: MemoryManager uses `process.memoryUsage()` directly instead of injected service
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated tests to mock `process.memoryUsage()` directly
- Fixed async/sync method call mismatches
- Updated mock for global.gc function

### 4. **Path Normalization Issues**
**Problem**: Test expectations had `./` prefix but implementation uses normalized paths
**Root Cause**: `path.join()` normalizes paths, removing redundant `./`
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated test expectations to match normalized paths

### 5. **Undefined tempDir Issues**
**Problem**: Tests failing due to undefined tempDir variable
**Root Cause**: Variable declared but not initialized
**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `tempDir: string;` to `tempDir: string = '';` in all test files

## Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/fix-failing-tests.js`**
   - Applies automated fixes for common test issues
   - Updates fs-extra mocks
   - Fixes tempDir initialization
   - Updates memory manager mocks

2. **`scripts/fix-di-bindings.js`**
   - Fixes dependency injection binding issues
   - Creates test helpers for GLSPGenerator
   - Updates container configurations

3. **`scripts/test-status-summary.js`**
   - Provides comprehensive test status report
   - Groups failures by category
   - Suggests fixes for common issues

## Next Steps

1. Run all tests: `yarn test`
2. For failing tests, check:
   - Import statements are correct
   - All required mocks are in place
   - DI container bindings match expected types
   - Async/sync method calls match implementation

3. Individual test debugging:
   ```bash
   # Run specific test file
   yarn test src/__tests__/commands/generate.command.test.ts
   
   # Run with verbose output
   yarn test --reporter=verbose
   ```

## Remaining Issues

Some tests may still fail due to:
1. Complex DI setup requirements
2. Specific mock configurations needed
3. Integration test environment setup

These require manual investigation and fixes based on the specific test requirements.

## Test Categories Status

### ✅ Passing Categories
- Documentation generator tests
- Handlebars helpers tests
- Langium parser tests  
- Config loader tests
- Grammar examples tests

### ❌ Failing Categories
- Command tests (fs-extra and DI issues)
- Generator tests (DI issues)
- Performance tests (mock mismatches)
- Some integration tests

## Conclusion

The majority of test failures were due to:
1. Incorrect fs-extra mocking
2. Missing DI bindings
3. Mock expectation mismatches

The automated fixes address most common issues. Remaining failures require specific investigation based on individual test requirements.
