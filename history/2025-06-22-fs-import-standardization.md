# FS Import Standardization

Date: 2025-06-22

## Summary
Standardized all file system imports across the codebase to consistently use `fs-extra` with default import syntax.

## Changes Made

### 1. Standardized Import Pattern
Changed all fs imports to use:
```typescript
import fs from 'fs-extra';
```

### 2. Files Updated

#### Documentation Module (was using built-in 'fs')
- `src/documentation/collector.ts` - Changed from `import * as fs from 'fs'`
- `src/documentation/generator.ts` - Changed from `import * as fs from 'fs'`
- `src/documentation/renderer.ts` - Changed from `import * as fs from 'fs'`

#### Performance Module (was using namespace imports)
- `src/performance/cache-manager.ts` - Changed from `import * as fs from 'fs-extra'`
- `src/performance/monitor.ts` - Changed from `import * as fs from 'fs-extra'`
- `src/performance/streaming-parser.ts` - Changed from `import { createReadStream } from 'fs'`
  - Updated usage: `createReadStream()` → `fs.createReadStream()`

#### Utils Module
- `src/utils/paths.ts` - Changed from `import { existsSync } from 'fs'`
  - Updated usage: `existsSync()` → `fs.existsSync()`

### 3. Files NOT Changed
- `src/test-generation/e2e-test-generator.ts` - Contains `import * as fs from 'fs/promises'` inside a template string that generates Playwright test code. This is intentional as it generates code for a different runtime environment.

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All modules now use the same import pattern
2. **Enhanced functionality**: fs-extra provides promise-based methods and additional utilities
3. **Better error handling**: fs-extra methods handle errors more gracefully
4. **Type safety**: Consistent import style improves TypeScript inference

## Migration Script

Created `scripts/standardize-fs-imports.js` that:
- Automatically updates import statements
- Fixes function call references
- Scans for remaining non-standard imports
- Preserves template strings that generate external code

## Verification

After standardization:
- All source files use `import fs from 'fs-extra'`
- No mixing of built-in fs and fs-extra
- Consistent default import pattern
- Template-generated code remains unchanged

## Notes

- The fs-extra library is a drop-in replacement for the built-in fs module
- It provides all native fs methods plus additional utilities
- Promise-based methods are available by default (e.g., `fs.readFile()` returns a promise)
- The library ensures cross-platform compatibility
