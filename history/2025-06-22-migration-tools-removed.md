# Migration Tools Removal

Date: 2025-06-22

## Summary
The migration tools feature (Prompt 011) has been completely removed from the GLSP Generator project.

## Reason
The user requested complete removal of the migration tools feature, stating it was incomplete.

## Changes Made

### Files Deleted
- `src/migration/` - Entire directory and all contents removed
  - `index.ts` - Migration module exports
  - `types.ts` - Migration type definitions
  - `antlr-converter.ts` - ANTLR4 to Langium converter
  - `xtext-converter.ts` - Xtext to Langium converter
  - `glsp-analyzer.ts` - GLSP project analyzer
  - `upgrade-assistant.ts` - Version upgrade assistant
  - `migration-wizard.ts` - Interactive migration wizard
  - All test files in the migration directory
- `docs/migration-guide.md` - Migration documentation
- `history/2025-06-22-migration-tools-implementation.md`
- `history/2025-06-22-migration-tools-complete.md`

### Files Modified
1. **src/index.ts**
   - Removed: `export * from './migration/index.js';`

2. **src/cli.ts**
   - Removed migration-related imports
   - Removed `migrate` command
   - Removed `upgrade` command
   - Removed migration options from interactive mode

3. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Removed migration directory structure from documentation

4. **prompts/README.md**
   - Updated status of prompt-011 from "ðŸŸ¢ Completed" to "ðŸ”´ Removed"

5. **prompts/prompt-011-migration-tools.md**
   - Added status note indicating the feature was removed

## Impact
- The CLI no longer supports `migrate` and `upgrade` commands
- Users cannot convert ANTLR4 or Xtext grammars to Langium format
- Users cannot analyze existing GLSP projects for migration
- The interactive migration wizard is no longer available

## Alternative Solutions
Users who need to migrate from other grammar formats will need to:
1. Manually convert their grammars to Langium format
2. Use the Langium documentation for guidance
3. Create their GLSP extensions from scratch using the generator

## Verification
All references to migration functionality have been removed from:
- Source code
- CLI commands
- Documentation
- Test files
- Export statements
