# Monorepo Migration Summary - 2025-07-06

## Overview
Successfully converted the GLSP Generator from a single package to a monorepo structure containing:
1. **@glsp/generator** - The core GLSP generator library
2. **@glsp/vscode-extension** - VSCode extension for comfortable workflow

## Actions Taken

### 1. Monorepo Structure Created
- Executed `scripts/migrate-to-monorepo.js` to restructure the repository
- Moved all existing code to `packages/generator/`
- Created new `packages/vscode-extension/` for VSCode integration
- Updated root `package.json` with Yarn workspaces configuration

### 2. Fixed Build Issues
- Created missing `src/metadata/config-types.ts` with type definitions
- Fixed validation rules to implement `defaultSeverity` property
- Added `createDevServer` export to `dev-server.ts`
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in both packages
- Excluded test files from production build

### 3. VSCode Extension Implementation
- Created basic extension structure with context menu commands
- Implemented four commands:
  - Generate VSIX
  - Test VSIX in Extension Host
  - Generate Project Only
  - Validate Grammar
- Fixed command implementations to match generator API
- Added proper TypeScript configuration with `esModuleInterop`

### 4. Setup Scripts Created
- `scripts/setup-global-access.ps1` - Makes generator globally accessible
- `scripts/install-vscode-extension.ps1` - Builds and installs VSCode extension
- Both scripts are PowerShell-compatible for Windows users

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Created comprehensive documentation:
  - `docs/MONOREPO_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Migration strategy
  - `docs/VSCODE_EXTENSION_DESIGN.md` - Extension architecture
  - `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - User workflow documentation

## Results
- ✅ Monorepo structure successfully created
- ✅ Both packages build without errors
- ✅ VSCode extension compiles successfully
- ✅ Global access scripts ready for use
- ✅ Documentation complete

## Next Steps
1. Test the VSCode extension with real grammar files
2. Package and install the VSCode extension
3. Verify global CLI access works correctly
4. Update main README with new workflow instructions

## Technical Details
- Yarn Berry (v4.9.2) for monorepo management
- Yarn workspaces for dependency management
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- VSCode extension uses CommonJS for compatibility
- Generator continues to use ES modules
