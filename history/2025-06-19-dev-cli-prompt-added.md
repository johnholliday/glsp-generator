# Added Development CLI Enhancement Prompt

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Action**: Created prompt-013 for development CLI with Yargs and Yarn Link

## Summary
Added a new enhancement prompt to create a developer-friendly CLI using Yargs that can be globally linked for testing from any directory.

## Motivation
The current CLI requires navigating to the project directory and using `node dist/cli.js`, which is cumbersome during development. A globally-linked `glsp` command would significantly improve the development workflow.

## Key Features of Prompt 013

### 1. Yargs Integration
- Better command organization
- Built-in help generation  
- Type-safe argument parsing
- Command aliases and shortcuts

### 2. Global Command
- `glsp` command available system-wide after `yarn link`
- Short aliases: `glsp gen`, `glsp val`, `glsp w`
- Works from any directory

### 3. Simplified Commands
```powershell
# Before
node dist/cli.js generate grammar.langium -o output

# After  
glsp gen grammar.langium output
```

### 4. Developer Features
- Interactive mode when arguments missing
- Debug output with `--debug` flag
- Test all examples with `glsp test-examples`
- PowerShell completion support

### 5. Setup Script
Includes `scripts/setup-dev-cli.js` for easy development setup:
- Builds the project
- Creates global yarn link
- Shows available commands

## Priority Justification
Marked as HIGH priority because:
- Directly improves developer experience
- Enables faster testing and iteration
- Required for efficient development workflow
- Complements other Phase 1 enhancements

## Implementation Impact
This enhancement will make it much easier to:
- Test the generator from any project directory
- Quickly validate grammars
- Use the tool in real development scenarios
- Demonstrate the tool to others
