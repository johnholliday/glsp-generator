# Enhancement Prompts Creation

**Date**: 2025-06-19
**Action**: Created structured enhancement prompts system

## Summary
Created a comprehensive system of enhancement prompts for the GLSP Generator project, organized in a dedicated `prompts/` folder.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Prompts Directory Structure
- Created `prompts/` directory at project root
- Added 12 individual prompt files for different enhancements
- Created README.md with status tracking system

### 2. Enhancement Categories

#### High Priority
- **001 - Template Validation**: Ensures Yarn 1.22 compatibility
- **002 - Grammar Test Suite**: Comprehensive examples and tests
- **004 - Watch Mode**: Auto-regeneration on grammar changes

#### Medium Priority
- **003 - Extension Config**: .glsprc.json configuration system
- **005 - Validation Diagnostics**: Enhanced error messages
- **006 - Documentation Generator**: Auto-generate docs from grammar
- **012 - Type Safety**: TypeScript declarations and Zod schemas

#### Lower Priority
- **007 - Test Infrastructure**: Generate tests for extensions
- **008 - CI/CD Templates**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **009 - Custom Templates**: Template override system
- **010 - Performance**: Optimizations for large grammars
- **011 - Migration Tools**: Convert from ANTLR/Xtext

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added prompts folder to directory structure
- Added section explaining enhancement prompts
- Clarified distinction between CLAUDE.md (instructions) and prompts (features)

## Implementation Strategy

The prompts are designed to be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1 - Critical** (001, 002, 004)
   - Ensures basic reliability and developer experience
   
2. **Phase 2 - Enhanced Features** (003, 005, 006, 012)
   - Improves usability and type safety
   
3. **Phase 3 - Advanced** (007-011)
   - Adds professional features

## Benefits

- Clear roadmap for project enhancements
- Self-contained implementation instructions
- Priority and dependency tracking
- Maintains separation between operating instructions and feature requests

## Next Steps

To implement an enhancement:
1. Select a prompt based on priority
2. Copy prompt content to Claude Code
3. Implement the feature
4. Update status in prompts/README.md
5. Create tests and documentation
