# GLSP Generator Features

This directory contains detailed documentation for each major feature of the GLSP Generator. These documents are designed to be used as input for generating Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs) for feature implementation or enhancement.

## Core Features

### 1. [Grammar Parsing](./01-grammar-parsing.md)
The foundation of GLSP Generator - parses Langium grammar files into structured ASTs for code generation.

### 2. [Code Generation](./02-code-generation.md)
Template-based code generation system that transforms grammar ASTs into complete GLSP extensions.

### 3. [CLI Interface](./03-cli-interface.md)
Comprehensive command-line interface with multiple commands for generation, validation, and development.

### 4. [Configuration System](./04-configuration.md)
Flexible JSON-based configuration with schema validation, interpolation, and environment support.

### 5. [Validation & Linting](./05-validation-linting.md)
Grammar validation with built-in rules for error detection and code quality enforcement.

### 6. [Performance Optimization](./06-performance-optimization.md)
Advanced optimization features including parallel processing, memory management, and caching.

### 7. [Type Safety](./07-type-safety.md)
Comprehensive TypeScript type generation with runtime validation, guards, and schema definitions.

### 8. [Test Generation](./08-test-generation.md)
Automatic generation of unit, integration, and E2E tests with factories and utilities.

### 9. [Documentation Generation](./09-documentation-generation.md)
Automated documentation creation including API references, examples, and visual diagrams.

### 10. [CI/CD Support](./10-cicd-support.md)
Generation of CI/CD pipelines for multiple platforms with automated testing and deployment.

### 11. [Watch Mode](./11-watch-mode.md)
File watching with automatic regeneration, live reload, and development server integration.

### 12. [Interactive Mode](./12-interactive-mode.md)
Guided user interface with prompts for configuration and step-by-step project setup.

### 13. [Template Management](./13-template-management.md)
Flexible template system with customization, packages, inheritance, and hot-reloading.

### 14. [Service Integration Layer](./14-service-integration.md)
Extensibility layer that connects generated extensions with external services through configurable service maps, command bindings, and comprehensive mock implementations.

## Feature Document Structure

Each feature document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - High-level description of the feature
2. **Purpose** - Why the feature exists and what problems it solves
3. **Current Implementation** - How the feature is currently implemented
4. **Technical Details** - Deep dive into technical aspects
5. **Usage Examples** - Real-world usage scenarios
6. **Configuration** - Available configuration options
7. **Best Practices** - Recommended usage patterns
8. **Future Enhancements** - Planned improvements
9. **Dependencies** - Required packages and libraries
10. **Testing** - Testing strategies and approaches
11. **Related Features** - Links to related features

## Using These Documents

### For PRP Generation

These documents can be used as input to the `/generate-prp` command to create detailed product requirements for:

1. **New Feature Implementation** - Use as reference for implementing similar features
2. **Feature Enhancement** - Understand current state before planning improvements
3. **Bug Fixes** - Understand feature architecture for targeted fixes
4. **Documentation** - Create user-facing documentation from technical details
5. **Testing** - Develop comprehensive test strategies

### Example Usage

```
/generate-prp "Enhance the Type Safety feature to support JSON Schema generation" 
  --context features/07-type-safety.md
```

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Create a new markdown file following the naming pattern: `XX-feature-name.md`
2. Follow the established document structure
3. Update this README with the new feature
4. Cross-reference with related features
5. Include comprehensive examples

## Architecture Overview

```
User Input (Grammar) → Parser → Validator → Generator → Templates → Output
       +                   ↓                      ↓           ↓
Service Map         Configuration           Type Safety    Services
       ↓                   ↓                      ↓           ↓
  Commands            CLI/Watch              Testing      Mocks
       ↓                   ↓                      ↓           ↓
   Bindings          Documentation             CI/CD      Tests
```

This modular architecture allows each feature to be developed, tested, and enhanced independently while maintaining clean interfaces between components.
