# V2 Refactoring Archive

This directory contains the incomplete v2 refactoring effort that was started but not finished.

## What is this?

This was an ambitious attempt to refactor the GLSP Generator to follow a more modern, service-oriented architecture with:

- **SOLID Principles**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
- **Dependency Injection**: Using InversifyJS for IoC container
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Plugin system with event bus
- **Service Layer**: Orchestrators, validators, parsers as services
- **Native Langium AST**: Direct use of Langium's Grammar AST without custom conversion

## Why was it archived?

The refactoring was incomplete and having both the old and new code in the main source tree was:
1. Making the codebase confusing
2. Potentially breaking existing functionality
3. Creating maintenance overhead

## Archived Files

### Core Architecture
- `core/` - Core interfaces and services (IGenerator, IParser, etc.)
- `infrastructure/` - Cross-cutting concerns (DI, logging, errors, events)
- `parser/` - New Langium grammar parser implementation
- `cli-refactored.ts` - New CLI using dependency injection

### Service Implementations
- `templates/services/` - Template engine services
- `templates/strategies/` - Template rendering strategies (browser, server, common)
- `validation/services/` - Validation service implementations
- `validation/interfaces/` - Validation contracts
- `validation/rules/` - Validation rule implementations

### Adapters and Bridges
- `GenerateCommandAdapter.ts` - Adapter for generate command
- `bridge-container.ts` - DI container bridge

### Refactored Files
- `langium-grammar-parser.refactored.ts`
- `linter.refactored.ts`
- `package-manager.refactored.ts`
- `test-generator.refactored.ts`
- `type-safety-generator.refactored.ts`

## Key Concepts from V2

1. **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Each major functionality as a service
2. **Dependency Injection**: All services wired through InversifyJS
3. **Event System**: Extensibility through events
4. **Plugin Architecture**: Extend without modifying core
5. **Native Langium Integration**: Use Grammar AST directly

## Status

This refactoring is **INCOMPLETE** and was archived on 2025-07-04 to clean up the main codebase.

## Future Considerations

If this refactoring is to be resumed:
1. Complete the service implementations
2. Write comprehensive tests for all new components
3. Create a migration path from v1 to v2
4. Ensure backward compatibility or provide clear breaking change documentation
5. Complete the dependency injection setup
6. Fully integrate with existing CLI commands

## Note

The working v1 code remains in the main source tree and is fully functional. This archive is kept for reference and potential future use.
